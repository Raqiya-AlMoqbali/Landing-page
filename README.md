# Landing Page

Welcome to the Landing Page repository. This repository contains a simple landing page template designed to showcase a product, service, or project in a visually appealing manner.

## Introduction
This project build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.


## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The landing page is designed using responsive web design principles, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Easy Customization:** The template is easy to customize, allowing you to modify the content, colors, and layout to suit your specific needs.
- **Minimalistic Design:** With a clean and minimalistic design, the landing page focuses on presenting key information effectively without unnecessary distractions.
- **HTML/CSS:** The landing page is built using HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easy to understand for developers of all levels.
- **Social Media Integration:** Includes links to social media profiles or relevant external resources to enhance user engagement.
